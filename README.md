With the application we developed, we wish to create a change in the social life of young people in Jerusalem 
and to help people meet new friends

an web app that developed for "Bina - the jewish movement for social change" and especially for  the "Yeshiva Hilunit in Jerusalem" 
The app supports the following functionality:
* authentication with google or facebook account
* view all the courses 
* offer new course 
* registration for a course
* manage all the courses on the site - only manager can access the page
